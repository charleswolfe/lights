lights
======

Lights is my take on Geoff Johnson's Raspberry Pi mains switching tutorial. Except I plan to use Woods 13569 from amazon [http://www.amazon.com/Woods-13569-Wireless-Control-Outlets/dp/B003ZTWYXY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360605592&sr=8-1&keywords=remote+outlet]
I'm planning to add a flashier UI, PHP and Javascript and make a mobile application.
